Find Python code that looks public but is only used privately.

Privata is a static checker for keeping module boundaries intentional.
It scans your production Python modules and reports five kinds of interface drift:

- public top-level functions, classes, variables, and type aliases that are only used inside their own module
- public methods such as `Service.helper` that no other production module ever refers to (opt in with `--methods`)
- imports of private modules such as `pkg._internal` from outside their owning package subtree
- imports of private top-level symbols such as `pkg.service._Helper` from another production module
- literal `__all__` declarations that are stale, incomplete, or exporting names that do not exist

It is designed for packages and applications where `helper()` should become `_helper()` once it is no longer part of the production interface.
Test imports do not count, so tests can still reach internals without forcing those internals to stay public.

## Example

Given:

```python
# src/example/service.py
def helper() -> int:
    return 1


def run() -> int:
    return helper()
```

Privata reports:

```text
Found 1 public symbols that could be made private:

  src/example/service.py:1: function `helper`
```

## Install

```bash
uv tool install privata
```

For local development:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --group docs
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Usage

Run Privata from a project root:

```bash
privata .
```

Privata uses `tach.toml` `source_roots` when present.
Otherwise it prefers `src/` when that directory exists, and falls back to scanning the project root while ignoring tests, virtualenvs, build output, docs output, and hidden tooling directories.

Use Privata as a pre-commit hook in another repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/basnijholt/privata
    rev: v0.1.2
    hooks:
      - id: privata
```

For a less strict setup that only runs when requested:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/basnijholt/privata
    rev: v0.1.2
    hooks:
      - id: privata-manual
```

```bash
pre-commit run --hook-stage manual privata-manual --all-files
```

Full output can include multiple issue types (`--methods` adds the method section):

```text
Found 2 public symbols that could be made private:

  src/example/service.py:12: function `helper`
  src/example/service.py:21: class `InternalState`

Found 1 public methods that could be made private:

  src/example/service.py:25: method `InternalState.reset`

Found 1 private module imports outside their package subtree:

  src/example/api.py:3: imports private module `example.worker._runtime`

Found 1 private symbol imports from production modules:

  src/example/api.py:4: imports private symbol `example.worker.runtime._Helper`

Found 1 __all__ export issues:

  src/example/__init__.py:5: public name `Service` missing from __all__
```

If the project is clean:

```text
No module privacy issues found.
```

## What Privata Checks

- Public top-level functions, classes, variables, and type aliases in production source roots.
- Whether those symbols are imported by another production module under those roots.
- Public methods of plain classes, and whether any other production module refers to them by name.
- Whether private modules such as `pkg._internal` are imported outside their containing package subtree.
- Whether private top-level symbols are imported from another production module.
- Whether literal `__all__` declarations exactly match public top-level bindings.
- Console entry points in `pyproject.toml`.
- Uvicorn entry points in shell scripts and Dockerfiles.
- Symbols exported through package `__init__.py` and `__all__`.
- Tach `[[interfaces]]` entries, when `tach.toml` is present.
- Module names defined by more than one file across source roots (e.g. `src/utils.py` next to `tests/utils.py`, or `pkg.py` next to `pkg/__init__.py`). Such names are ambiguous at import time and only one file per name can be scanned, so Privata reports the collision instead of silently picking one.
- Source files that cannot be parsed. A skipped file stops contributing references, so unrelated modules gain findings that are not real while genuine findings disappear. Privata reports the file first and fails the check, rather than reporting results it cannot stand behind. The usual cause is running Privata on an interpreter older than the syntax in the project, such as scanning a project that uses `type X = ...` on Python 3.11.

### Methods

A public method is reported when no other production module mentions its name, either as an attribute access such as `service.helper()` or as a string literal such as `getattr(service, "helper")`.
Use inside the defining module does not keep a method public, exactly as for top-level symbols.
Matching is intentionally name-based rather than receiver-aware, so an unrelated attribute with the same name in another module conservatively suppresses the report.

Because a method name can be owned by something Privata cannot see, the method check only looks at plain classes.
It skips:

- classes with a base class other than `object`, since the base may define the contract
- classes that another class in the project subclasses, since renaming a base method would strand the override under its old name
- classes with class keywords such as `metaclass=`, and classes with decorators other than `@dataclass` and `@final`
- private classes, classes listed in `__all__`, classes re-exported by package `__init__.py`, and classes exposed through entry points or Tach interfaces
- methods with decorators other than `@property`, `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, `@cached_property`, `@cache`, `@lru_cache`, and `@final`, since another decorator may register the method under its current name
- methods that call the same method through `super()`, since cooperative mixins must preserve that name
- dunder methods, methods that are already private, and classes nested inside functions or other classes

Privata intentionally ignores imports from `tests/`.
If only tests import a symbol, Privata treats that symbol as private.

**Exception — test helper modules in a test source root:** when `tach.toml` lists a directory such as `tests/` under `source_roots`, non-test files inside that root (e.g. `tests/something.py`) are scanned as ordinary modules. Imports from co-located test files *do* count as cross-module usage in this case, because those helper modules exist solely to serve the test suite. A symbol that at least one test file imports is treated as public; a symbol that no test file imports is still flagged as a private candidate.
For methods, a test file that imports a helper module certifies every method name that file mentions. Attribution is per file rather than per receiver, so a helper a test never imports is still checked, while a helper it does import is credited generously.

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest  # enforces 100% coverage
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv build
